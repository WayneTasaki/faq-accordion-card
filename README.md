## About This Project

<p>This challenge was to build out an FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

<br>
<br>
Your users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
3. Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
4. Bonus: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript</p>
<br>
<br>



## Built with

<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>

## What I learned
- My first Frontendmentor challenge using Javascript! Instead of creating the accordion from scratch, I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp" target="_blank">W3 School's "How To - Collapsibles/Accordion/</a> page as a base and then changed the code as I needed. It wasn't just styling that needed changing, I also added blocks of code for the arrows to change from an up or down position, as well as the functionality where only 1 panel can be opened at a time.
- I had difficulty getting the orange block and the woman at the computer images to position correctly. I used negative margins and absolute positioning but found inconsistencies when using Firefox/Chrome so I had to come up with another solution. I instead chose to have the main card be split in half using grid, and wrapped the two images so I didn't have to fight with margins bumping other content out of position.
